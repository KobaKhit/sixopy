At the age of 3, Samantha was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. After her diagnosis, Sam began a three-year treatment protocol which included chemotherapy and several inpatient stays at Children's Hospital of Michigan in Detroit. Following her initial treatment, Sam was declared in remission. Unfortunately, nearly one year later at the age of 7, Sam developed new symptoms that were identified as a relapse of her cancer. An avid Detroit Red Wings fan, Sam used the team as inspiration while battling through additional treatments.

But, last year for me was a special year to have a chance to play with him, his presence in the locker room, on the ice, he was one the best players and leaders we had\" - Henrik Zetterberg\n#Alfie #Sticktaps #Legend #LGRW","comments":105,"created_time":1417719585000,"likes":14743,"location":null,"type":"image","url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/wNEFVjR4w8\/","user":"detroitredwings","created_date":"2014-12-04"},{"caption":"Throwback Thursday: 3 former GLI participants celebrate Luke Glendening's first career NHL goal! \nJust one month until the 50th Annual GLI!

In accordance with team policy, additional terms of the deal will not be disclosed. Smith, 24, was selected by the Red Wings in the first round (27th overall) of the 2007 National Hockey League Entry Draft.  The 6-1, 199-lb. blueliner recently completed his first full season in Detroit. He skated in 34 regular season games for the Red Wings in 2012-13, posting eight points (0G-8A-8P) and 36 PIM.  Smith missed 11 games this year due to a shoulder injury and was a healthy scratch for three contests. In 48 career NHL games, he has posted 15 points (1G-14A-15P) and 49 PIM.  Smith also appeared in all 14 postseason games for Detroit this season, collecting five points (2G-3A-5P) and 10 PIM. Smith spent parts of the last three seasons with the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League.  In 152 career AHL contests, he registered 86 points (27G-59A-86P) and 263 PIM.
